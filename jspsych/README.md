# Resources for [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/)

We've implemented some generic methods for audio testing with jsPsych:

* A plugin to do alternative forced choice with sounds: [jspsych-audio-sequence-button-response](docs/jspsych-audio-sequence-button-response.md).
* A plugin to do extend `audio-keyboard-response`: [jspsych-audio-keyboard-response-wait](docs/jspsych-audio-keyboard-response-wait.md).
* A plugin to display a Coordinate Response Measure interface: [jspsych-crm](docs/jspsych-crm.md).
* A plugin to do display a loading spinner while waiting for a (possible async) function to complete: [jspsych-waitfor-function](docs/jspsych-waitfor-function.md).
* A function that generates timelines for adaptive testing using a nAFC interface: [jspsych-nafc-adaptive](docs/jspsych-nafc-adaptive.md).
