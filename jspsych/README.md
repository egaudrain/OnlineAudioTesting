# Resources for [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/)

We've implemented some generic methods for audio testing with jsPsych:

* A plugin to do alternative forced choice with sounds: [jspsych-audio-sequence-button-response](docs/jspsych-audio-sequence-button-response.md)
* A function that generates timelines for adaptive testing using a nAFC interface: [jspsych-nafc-adaptive](docs/jspsych-nafc-adaptive.md)
